# MERN_Architecture

Example of MERN architecture to create a website with a Database (Mongo), a Backend (NodeJS) and a Frontend (ReactJS).

## Launch Project :

At the root of the project, enter the following command :

`docker-compose up --build`

>❗️ Attention
>
> Don't forget to launch the Docker Desktop app.

By doing this you will build the project for the first time.\
After that you can enter the following command :

`docker-compose up`  or  `docker-compose up -d`

## Down the Project :

To destroy the containers, enter the following command :

`docker-compose down`

> 🚧 Advice
>
> Remember to delete your images on your Docker Desktop application, if you ever make significant changes due to image cache problems.
